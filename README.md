# USB 3 Type A Breakout Board

I needed a USB breakout for some prototyping work and could not find one. So, I made one. Feel free to use it if you need one. There are two connections for VBUS and GND to provide options for power connection.

This accepts a USB 3.x type A style socket, such as Digikey part number 2057-USB-A3-S-RA-ND.
